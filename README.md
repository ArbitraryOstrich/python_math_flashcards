This is just a simple math flash card generator. I used it as a project to fiddle with and to make sure I can do some mental math practice when i need to.

I probably wouldn't use tinydb for stats tracking like I have here again.

Types of flash card it will generate.

   Multiplication

   Division

   Addition

   Subtraction

   Mixed

   base10 to binary

   binary to base10
